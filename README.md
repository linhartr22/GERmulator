Altair 8800 Emulator written in GameMaker: Studio 1.4

Version 16
Adds SIO and Serial Terminal.
SIO maps to ports 80h & 81h.
Serial Terminal supports:
  CR = Carriage Return. Moves cursor to beginning of line.
  LF = Line Feed. Moves cursor down one line.
  VT = Vertical Tab. Clear Screen.
I also found a couple of errors in the microcode.

Version 15
Adds CPU Display. Left clicking the CPU icon toggles the CPU Display on and off. The display can be scrolled up or down with the mouse wheel.
